Project Overview Document: AI-Powered Company Onboarding Agent
Executive Summary
We're building an intelligent onboarding agent that transforms how employees learn internal company knowledge. The system addresses the critical pain point of slow, inefficient knowledge transfer by creating an AI-powered two-sided platform where admins can rapidly convert unstructured company content into structured learning experiences, while employees receive personalized, just-in-time guidance that adapts to their individual learning patterns.
This agent eliminates the traditional problems of feeling lost during onboarding, knowledge decay over time, and inefficient human-to-human knowledge transfer. By providing always-available support and dynamically improving based on user struggles, it ensures employees reach autonomous task execution confidence faster and with greater retention.
The system serves dual user experiences: course creation for admins and adaptive learning for all employees, with intelligent prerequisite tracking and dynamic content optimization based on real user learning patterns.
User Problem Statement
Primary Job-to-be-Done: Employees need to rapidly understand and become productive with company-specific knowledge (tools, processes, repositories, institutional knowledge) without feeling lost, overwhelmed, or dependent on colleagues for basic information.
Core User Problems:
Current onboarding is painfully slow and leaves users feeling lost and confused
Knowledge transfer through documentation and human handovers is inefficient and inconsistent
Employees forget critical information over time and need constant refreshers
Different experience levels require different learning approaches, but current methods are one-size-fits-all
Just-in-time learning support is unavailable when employees need immediate answers during actual work
User Context & Scenarios
Primary User Contexts:
Just-in-Time Learning: Employee encounters unfamiliar process during actual work execution


Scenario: Sarah needs to deploy code but doesn't remember the approval workflow
Context: High-pressure work situation, needs immediate accurate guidance
Emotional state: Anxious about making mistakes, frustrated by process blockers
Proactive Skill Building: Employee preparing for new responsibilities or tools


Scenario: Marketing team adopting new analytics platform before campaign launch
Context: Dedicated learning time, planning future work
Emotional state: Motivated but overwhelmed by complexity
Knowledge Validation: Employee unsure if they understand process correctly


Scenario: Junior developer wants to confirm deployment steps before executing
Context: Confidence-building before high-stakes task
Emotional state: Seeking reassurance, afraid of appearing incompetent
Course Creation: Admin needs to package existing knowledge into learnable format


Scenario: Engineering manager converting scattered deployment docs into structured course
Context: Content curation and knowledge organization
Emotional state: Focused on accuracy and completeness
User Journey Narrative
Admin Journey - Course Creation: Admin receives scattered company content from multiple sources (Notion, Confluence, emails, videos, audio). They upload all materials to the agent, which processes and analyzes the content. The agent drafts a structured course outline with hierarchical modules and identifies critical prerequisites. Admin reviews and refines the course structure through conversational interaction. Once approved, the course becomes available to all employees with the agent monitoring user interactions to identify content gaps.
Employee Journey - Learning Experience: Employee discovers relevant course through search or recommendation. They access the course and begin learning through conversational interaction with the agent. The agent provides step-by-step guidance while allowing flexible navigation between modules. As the employee asks questions, the agent tracks their understanding against prerequisites and identifies knowledge gaps. After completing modules, the agent generates personalized quizzes based on the employee's specific questions and learning patterns. The agent remains available for ongoing question-answering, eliminating the need for knowledge refreshers.
Key User Insights
Critical Behavioral Patterns:
Users prefer step-by-step guidance regardless of experience level
Learning happens simultaneously with task execution, not in isolation
Questions asked reveal specific misunderstandings better than quiz results alone
Different users learn at different paces but benefit from consistent core knowledge
Confidence comes from successful task execution, not just content consumption
User Psychology Findings:
Fear of appearing incompetent drives users to avoid asking human colleagues
Anxiety about making mistakes increases when learning complex processes
Users feel lost when they can't find specific information quickly
Confidence builds through validated understanding and successful task completion
Users abandon learning when they can't see immediate practical application
Motivation Drivers:
Immediate work needs (just-in-time learning)
Confidence building before high-stakes tasks
Autonomy and independence from colleagues
Mastery of role-specific tools and processes
Design Principles
Intelligent Adaptability: The agent adapts to individual learning patterns while maintaining consistent core knowledge standards
Just-in-Time Support: Information is available exactly when and where users need it during actual work
Confidence Building: Every interaction should increase user confidence through clear guidance and validation
Seamless Integration: Learning happens within the context of work, not as separate activity
Continuous Improvement: The system learns from user struggles to improve content for everyone
Prerequisite Mastery: Core concepts must be understood before advancing to complex topics
Flexible Pathways: Users can navigate content based on immediate needs while ensuring foundational knowledge
